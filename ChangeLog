	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.5.
	* "snorm" is now the skew normal distribution
	reparametrized in terms of mean and standard deviation.
	In the previous "snorm" of version 0.1.4 there was also a
	bug in the unmapping function.
	* Bug correction for quantile function and cdf of "norm".
	* Bug correction for static optimization

	* New distribution: Skellam.
	* New lower bound for degree of freedom is 2.01. Before was 4.0.
	* Additional argument Compute.SE for UniGASFit, MultiGASFit, UniGASRoll, MultiGASRoll.
